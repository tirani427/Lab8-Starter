### Question about service workers and graceful degradation

For one, graceful degradation is working on the core features of an application and making sure that such features are applicable and functional across all platforms. In order to do so, there have to be certain fallbacks that are put in place for when certain functions aren't able to be run on web browsers. It's only once this functionality is achieved that other features are added. In a similar sense, service workers and graceful degradation are related because service workers provide another solution to when the network itself isn't available for the web browser. So, by using the cache that is obtained from the service worker, there can still be a somewhat usable experience maintained. So, while the network would still be disconnected, whatever is in the cache can still be loaded onto the page.
